/**
 An actor that represents a connection to an IMAP server.
 
 Use this class to establish and manage connections to IMAP servers, perform authentication,
 and execute IMAP commands. The class handles connection lifecycle, command execution,
 and maintains server state.
 
 Example:
 ```swift
 let server = IMAPServer(host: "imap.example.com", port: 993)
 try await server.connect()
 try await server.login(username: "user@example.com", password: "password")
 ```
 
 - Note: All operations are logged using the Swift Logging package. To view logs in Console.app:
 1. Open Console.app
 2. Search for "process:com.cocoanetics.SwiftMail"
 3. Adjust the "Action" menu to show Debug and Info messages
